# ConwaysGameofLife
A C++ code that plays the game "Conway's Game of Life" and simulates it in the console.
Based on a project I had to do for university.
Rules:
1. A cell will be DEAD in the next generation (regardless of its current state) if,
   in the current generation, it has fewer than two living neighbors (loneliness)
   or more than three living neighbors (overpopulation).
2. A cell with exactly two living neighbors will remain in its current state.
3. A cell with exactly three living neighbors will be ALIVE in the next generation.
